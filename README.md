If there is a file that is encrypted in a folder along with other files that have been decrypted, and the user runs the application to decrypt that one(or multiple) encrypted file(s), it will result in an error. Basically, all files in any particular folder must be either decrypted or encrypted before running to encrypt/decrypt multiple files in a folder. This also applies to the encryption function as well.
